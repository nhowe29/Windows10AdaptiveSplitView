# Windows 10 Adaptive SplitView
Example Project Using Adaptive Layouts and Splitview for Windows 10

# Overview

The project contains two main components, the SplitView and its inner content. Within the SplitView you will notices a few things:

1. Adaptive Triggers.

	- Using simple adaptive triggers, we can make our application's UI adapt to the user's device and scenario.
	- Two sets of adaptive Triggers live in this project. One for the SplitView bar, and one for its content.

2. Radio Buttons.

	- Radio Buttons provide an excellent way for us to navigate our application, since by nature only one can be selected.
	- Add some text and an icon to a custom radio button layout, and there we have a nice set of navigation buttons.

3. Framed Content.

	- Instead of adding the content directly to the SplitView, we decouple the content, allowing us to easily specify different frames 
      for different views within the application.

# Requirements

- Visual Studio with Windows 10 Development Tools
	  
# TODO

- Add a hamburger menu to allow users to manually enable/disable the action bar.
- Home page. Currently you have to click an icon to populate the frame.
